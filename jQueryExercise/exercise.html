<!-- notes -->

<!--
	first, thru terminal, you make a new directory for your project and CHANGE into it.
	second, thru terminal, you NPM INIT  a node package and state that your ENTRY POINT is app.js
		(it will take the npm code and put in a NPM_MODULES directory on your machine)
	(you should see the package.json file now)
	third, touch your app.js file
	fourth, thru terminal, NPM INSTALL EXPRESS -- SAVE
	fifth - thru terminal, you NPM INSTALL EJS --SAVE
	sixth, thru the js file, you var  express = require("express");
	seventh, thru the js file, you can conlog the var to see it work (since you do not have access to an html file)
	eighth, then you var app = express(); // to run express and save it to a variable called app
	ninth, you define the root
		app.get("/", function(req, res){
			res.send("hi there.  welcome to my assignment!");
		});
	tenth, make sure you have a "listener" at the bottom of your app.js file
		// tell Express to listen for requests (start server)
		app.listen(process.env.PORT, process.env.IP, function(){
			console.log("server has started!!!");
		});
		// like listening for port 3000 except for cloud9

	eleventh, start adding your route pages like:
		app.get("/campgrounds", function(req, res){
			res.render("campgrounds");
		});
		(note that the campgrounds.ejs should be located off the root)
	twelth - add your partials directory in the VIEWS folder and create your header and footer includes
		in your header, add the bootstrap css cdn
		in your footer, add a p-tag for copyright (just to make sure it is working)
		in your body ejs page, make sure you put everything in a <div class="container"> div 
	thirteenth - you need to add your POST route.  ex.
			app.post("/campgrounds", function(req, res){
				// get data from form and add to campgrounds array
				res.send("You hit the POST route...");
				// redirect to campgrounds page
			});
			// you can use POSTMAN app to test your post requests
	fourteenth - npm install bodyparser --SAVE
		and include it as a var on the app.js page  var bodyParser = require("body-parser");
		then use it - app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: true})); -->
